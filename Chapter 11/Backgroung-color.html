    <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
    <p>
        Almost any thing can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from
        Earth crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important
        components of the seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature,
        dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These element
        vary in their composition as well as in their influence on the marine life.
